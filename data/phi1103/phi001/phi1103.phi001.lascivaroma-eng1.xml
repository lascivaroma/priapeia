                <div type="textpart" subtype="poem"><l>Thou, who be ready to read these cultureless sallies of singing,</l>
<l>Lower awhile yon brow suiting the Latian pride:</l>
<l>Here in this fane dwells not or Phoebus' sister or Vesta,</l>
<l>Neither the deity sprung forth of the patrial poll;</l>
<l>But the red guard of our garths, with organ grosser than rightful</l>
<l>Aye of his privities nude, guiltless of covering gear.</l>
<l>So with thy tunic hide what part is made to be hidden,</l>
<l>Or with what eyes see the parts deign these my lines to peruse.</l></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="poem"><l>In play, Priapus (thou canst testify),</l>
<l>Songs, fit for garden not for book-work, I</l>
<l>Wrote and none over-care applied thereto.</l>
<l>No Muses dared I (like the verseful crew)</l>
<l>Invite to visit such unvirginal site.</l>
<l>For heart and senses did forbid me quite</l>
<l>To set the choir Pïérian, chaste and fair,</l>
<l>Before Priapus' tool--such deed to dare.</l>
<l>Then whatsoe'er I wrote when idly gay,</l>
<l>And on this Temple-wall for note I lay,</l>
<l>Take in good part--such is the prayer I pray.</l></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="poem"><l></l></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="poem"><l>These tablets, sacred to the Rigid God,</l>
<l>From Elephantis' obscene booklets drawn,</l>
<l>Lalage offers and she prays thee try</l>
<l>To ply the painted figures' every part.</l></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="poem"><l>All the conditions (they say) Priapus made with the youngling</l>
<l>Written in verses twain mortals hereunder can read:</l>
<l>'Whatso my garden contains to thee shall be lawfullest plunder</l>
<l>If unto us thou give whatso thy garden contains.'</l></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="poem"><l>Though I be wooden Priapus (as thou see'st),</l>
<l>With wooden sickle and a prickle of wood,</l>
<l>Yet will I seize thee, girl! and hold thee seized</l>
<l>And This, however gross, withouten fraud</l>
<l>Stiffer than lyre-string or than twisted rope</l>
<l>I'll thrust and bury to thy seventh rib.</l></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="poem"><l>Oft in my speech one letter is lost; for Predicate always</l>
<l>Pedicate I pronounce. Reason--a trip of the tongue!</l></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="poem"><l>Matrons avoid this site, for your chaste breed</l>
<l>'Twere vile these verses impudique to read.</l>
<l>They still come on and not a doit they heed!</l>
<l>O'ermuch these matrons know and they regard</l>
<l>With willing glances this my vasty yard.</l></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="poem"><l>'Why be my parts obscene displayed without cover?' thou askest:</l>
<l>Ask I wherefore no God careth his sign to conceal?</l>
<l>Wieldeth the Lord of the World his thunderbolt ever unhidden,</l>
<l>Nor is trident a-sheath given to the Watery God:</l>
<l>Mars never veileth that blade whose might is his prevalent power,</l>
<l>Nor in her tepid lap Pallas concealeth the spear:</l>
<l>Say me, is Phoebus ashamed his gold-tipt arrows to carry?</l>
<l>Or is her quiver wont Dian in secret to bear?</l>
<l>Say, doth Alcides hide his war-club doughtily knotted?</l>
<l>Or hath the God with the wings rod hidden under his robe?</l>
<l>When did Bacchus endue with dress his willowy Thyrsus?</l>
<l>Who ever spied thee, Love! wilfully hiding thy torch?</l>
<l>Ne'er be reproach to myself this mentule ever uncover'd:</l>
<l>Lacking my missile's defence I shall be wholly unarm'd.</l></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="poem"><l>Why laugh such laughter, O most silly maid?</l>
<l>My form Praxiteles nor Scopas hewed;</l>
<l>To me no Phidian handwork finish gave;</l>
<l>But me a bailiff hacked from shapeless log,</l>
<l>And quoth my maker, 'Thou Priapus be!'</l>
<l>Yet on me gazing forthright gigglest thou</l>
<l>And holdest funny matter to deride</l>
<l>The pillar perking from the groin of me.</l></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="poem"><l>'Ware of my catching! If caught, with rod I never will harm thee</l>
<l>Nor to thee deal sore wound using my sickle that curves.</l>
<l>Pierced with a foot-long pole thy skin shall be stretched in such fashion</l>
<l>Thou shalt be fain to believe ne'er had a wrinkle thine arse.</l></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="poem"><l>A she (than Hector's parent longer aged,</l>
<l>Sister to Cumae's Sibyl seemeth me;</l>
<l>Equal to thee whom, to his home returned,</l>
<l>Theseus found lying in the fosse a-cold!)</l>
<l>Hither with tottering gait is wont to come;</l>
<l>And, wrinkled hands upraising to the stars,</l>
<l>Begs that she'll never fail a yard to find;</l>
<l>And, as yester'een she prayed ere daylight fled</l>
<l>One of three teeth she happened out to crache.</l>
<l>'Bear it afar (cried I) and let it lurk</l>
<l>Beneath thy tattered robe and tawny stole;</l>
<l>(Fen as 'tis ever wont); and dread the fight</l>
<l>Of meagre jaws which ope with such a gape--</l>
<l>By hairy nostrils capped and eminent nose--</l>
<l>Thou hadst deemed to see an Epicurean yawn.'</l></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="poem"><l>Thou shalt be pedicate (lad!), thou also (lass!) shalt be rogered;</l>
<l>While for the bearded thief is the third penalty kept.</l></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="poem"><l>Here' Here! nor dare expect (whoe'er thou be)</l>
<l>To 'scape the Lecher God's fane venerand;</l>
<l>And, if a damsel lay the night with thee,</l>
<l>From this my presence fear not to be bann'd</l>
<l>Fen as the sterner Gods of Heaven command.</l>
<l>The Ne'er-do-wells and paltry gods are we</l>
<l>Of rural worship and 'spite modesty</l>
<l>Aye under Jove with balls a-bare we stand:</l>
<l>Then enter whoso hither entry seek</l>
<l>Reckless of bawdy-house's blackened reek!</l></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="poem"><l>Charged to my charge the fieldlet who shall dare</l>
<l>With hand not modest anywise molest,</l>
<l>Me fox no eunuch he shall know and feet.</l>
<l>Here in a distant place the hurst amid</l>
<l>He peradventure to himself shall say--</l>
<l>'None! saw me so misused.' But he is wrong:</l>
<l>These huge attestors shall the cause maintain.</l></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="poem"><l>Rare as those apples wherewith Hippomenes Schoeneïs ravished;</l>
<l>Fair as the fruits that enfam'd Garths of the Hesperid maids;</l>
<l>Fen as one fancies the lot which, pacing her patrial vergers,</l>
<l>Nausicaä full oft bare in her well-fillèd lap;</l>
<l>Sweet as the pome whereon Acontius limnèd the letters</l>
<l>Which being read his Fair pledged to her love-longing swain;</l>
<l>Such be the fruits that youth who owneth the flourishing fieldlet</l>
<l>Placed on the table of stone, naked Priapus! for thee.</l></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="poem"><l>What hast thou, meddling watch, with me to do?</l>
<l>Why baulk the robber who to me would come?</l>
<l>Let him draw nigh: the laxer shall he go.</l></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="poem"><l>Aye in this prickle of ours the bonniest boon to be found is,</l>
<l>Loose for my daily use never a woman can be.</l></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="poem"><l>Will ever Telethusa, posture-mime,</l>
<l>Who with no tunic veiling hinder cheeks</l>
<l>Higher than her vitals heaves with apter geste</l>
<l>Wriggle to please thee with her wavy loins?</l>
<l>So thee, Priapus, not alone she'll move</l>
<l>E'en Phaedra's stepson shall her movement rouse.</l></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="poem"><l>Thunders are under Jove; with the trident weaponed is Neptune;</l>
<l>Forceful is Mars with brand, spear, O Minerva, is thine;</l>
<l>Liber engages in fray, confiding on sheaflets of Thyrsi;</l>
<l>By th' Apollinean hand shafts (they assure us) are shot;</l>
<l>Hercules' right is armed with the club that cannot be conquer'd;</l>
<l>But a distended yard makes me an object of awe.</l></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="poem"><l>Wealth is my loss! Do thou vouchsafe lend aid to my prayer,</l>
<l>Nor, by thy signal shown, me, O Priapus, betray:</l>
<l>Whatso before thee I laid, of home-grown apples the firstlings,</l>
<l>(Prithee, be pleased not to tell!) from Via Sacra be ta'en.</l></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="poem"><l>An fro' me woman shall thieve or plunder me man or a man-child,</l>
<l>She shall pay me with coynte, that with his mouth, this with arse.</l></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="poem"><l>Whoso of violets here shall pluck or rose,</l>
<l>Or furtive greens or apples never bought,</l>
<l>May he in want of woman or of boy</l>
<l>By the same tension you in me behold</l>
<l>Go burst, I ever pray, and may his yard</l>
<l>Against his navel throb and rap in vain.</l></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="poem"><l>Here has the bailiff, now of this plentiful garden the guardian,</l>
<l>Bidden me care for the place he to my service entrusts.</l>
<l>Thief! thou shalt suffer the pain albeit crying in anger--</l>
<l>'What! for a cabbage all this? This for a cabbage I bear?'</l></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="poem"><l>This staff of office cut from tree as 'tis,</l>
<l>No more with leafage green for aye to bloom;</l>
<l>Staff by the pathic damsels fondly loved,</l>
<l>Which e'en the kings delight in hand to hold</l>
<l>And oft by noble catamites bekissed--</l>
<l>This staff in robbers' vitals deep shall plunge</l>
<l>Up to its bushy base and bag of balls.</l></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="poem"><l>Hither, Quirites! (here what limit is?)</l>
<l>Either my member seminal lop ye off</l>
<l>Which thro' the livelong nights for aye fatigue</l>
<l>The neighbour-women rutting endlessly,</l>
<l>Lewder than sparrows in the lusty spring;</l>
<l>Or I shall burst and ye Priapus lose.</l>
<l>How I be futtered-out yourselves espy</l>
<l>Used-up, bejaded, lean and pallid grown,</l>
<l>Who erstwhile ruddy, in my doughtiness wont</l>
<l>To kill with poking thieves however doughty.</l>
<l>My side has failed me and poor I with cough</l>
<l>The perilous spittle ever must outspew.</l></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="poem"><l>Well-known darling of folk in the Circus Maximus far famed,</l>
<l>Quinctia, tremulous hips trainèd and artful to wag,</l>
<l>Cymbals and castanets (the wanton arms) to Priapus</l>
<l>Offers and tambourine struck with the hand to self drawn.</l>
<l>Wherefore prays she that aye she please her mob of admirers;</l>
<l>Let one and all stand stiff after the wont of her god.</l></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="poem"><l>Thou, of unrighteous thought, that hardly canst</l>
<l>Refrain from robbing this my garden-plot,</l>
<l>With foot-long fascinum shalt bulghar'd be:</l>
<l>Yet if so mighty grievous punishment</l>
<l>Profit thee naught, at higher stead I'll strike.</l></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="poem"><l>Priapus! perish I an words obscene</l>
<l>And wicked terms to use I'm not ashamed:</l>
<l>But whenas thou, a god (bylaying shame),</l>
<l>To me displayest bollocks evident,</l>
<l>With Coynte the Prickle I must baldly name.</l></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="poem"><l>Dreadful wi' sickle and dire with thy greater part, O Priapus!</l>
<l>Prithee to me point out which be the way to the fount?</l></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="poem"><l>Hie thee amid these vines whereof an thou gather a grape-bunch</l>
<l>Guest! of the water shalt drink serving for different use.</l></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="poem"><l>Long as thy wanton hand to pluck refrain</l>
<l>Chaster than Vesta's self thou may'st remain</l>
<l>Else thee my belly's arm shall loosen so</l>
<l>Out of thy proper anus thou shalt flow.</l></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="poem"><l>A damsel drier than the raisin'd grape,</l>
<l>Warmer than boxwood or than virgin wax,</l>
<l>Who pismires clustering on her every limb</l>
<l>Maketh a bulky-corpulent folk appear;</l>
<l>One whose unopened bowels through her skin</l>
<l>The Tuscan wizard can at will prospect;</l>
<l>One who like rotten pounce so lacking juice</l>
<l>None ever saw her with a slavering lip;</l>
<l>One whom for blood her arteries within</l>
<l>To have sand or sawdust differing leeches deem--</l>
<l>Such one to visit me anights is wont</l>
<l>Bringing with ghostly leanness ghastly hue;</l>
<l>Whist I (like island iron-forger) seem</l>
<l>To rub and rasp me on a lanthorn's horn</l></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="poem"><l>Wont the Priapi of old were to have both Naiads and Dryads</l>
<l>And the stiff vein of the God all had what causes to droop;</l>
<l>Now there's naught of the kind; now so fulfilled my desire is</l>
<l>Fain am I left to believe every Nymph to be dead.</l>
<l>Vile thing 'twere to be done, but lest I burst me with straining</l>
<l>Sickle unhanding I mistress must make of my hand.</l></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="poem"><l>At holy offering to the Lustful God</l>
<l>Hired was a harlot for a slender price</l>
<l>To meet the common wants of commonweal;</l>
<l>And for as many men one night outworked</l>
<l>So many willow yards she'll give to thee.</l></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="poem"><l>Thief, for first thieving shalt be swived, but an</l>
<l>Again arrested shalt be irrumate;</l>
<l>And, shouldst attempt to plunder time the third,</l>
<l>This and that penalty thou shalt endure,</l>
<l>Being both pedicate and irrumate.</l></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="poem"><l>We all show special notes of bodily shape:</l>
<l>Long-haired is Phoebus, arm-strong Hercules,</l>
<l>And tender Bacchus owneth virginal form;</l>
<l>Pallas hath grey-blue eyes, Venus a cast;</l>
<l>Th' Arcadian Fauns thou seest bloody-browed</l>
<l>And the Gods' Messenger shows proper feet;</l>
<l>The Guard of Lemnos moves unequal steps;</l>
<l>Ever untrimmed is Aesculapius' beard;</l>
<l>None hath a broader breast than bully Mars;</l>
<l>But, an Priapus' rank 'mid these remain,</l>
<l>There be no better-membered deity.</l></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="poem"><l>Why on memorial tablet do they limn</l>
<l>(You ask) the member which begets us all?</l>
<l>Whenas by accident my yard was hurt</l>
<l>And I (unhappy!) feared the surgeon's hand</l>
<l>To such legitimate almighty gods--</l>
<l>Phoebus for instance take or Phoebus' son--</l>
<l>I blushed to offer for a cure my cock</l>
<l>And prayed--'Priapus, an thou heal the part,</l>
<l>O Sire, whose very counterpart thou seem'st</l>
<l>And without hacking make it whole again,</l>
<l>One linmed on tablet shall to thee be given</l>
<l>Like-sized, like-coloured and alike of shape.'</l>
<l>The God to promise deigning wagged his yard,</l>
<l>By way of nod divine, and did my bede.</l></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="poem"><l>Simply to thee I say whatever to say shall behove me,</l>
<l>Since my 'nature' alway openly showeth to fight;</l>
<l>Fain would I pedicate thee who'rt Fain to plunder my apples;</l>
<l>An my want thou shalt grant, eke shall be granted thy want.</l></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="poem"><l>Form-charms in Mercury have might to please;</l>
<l>Form in Apollo is conspicuous charm;</l>
<l>Formose in picture is Lyaeus limned</l>
<l>And Cupid most formose of all is shown.</l>
<l>Freely of lovely form the lack I own;</l>
<l>Yet is our mentule a resplendent gem;</l>
<l>And this to th'erst-named gods shall aye prefer</l>
<l>The damsel dowered with no fatuous coynte.</l></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="poem"><l>Yon Telethusa befamèd amid the damsels Suburran</l>
<l>(Who by her gains I hold freedwoman now is become)</l>
<l>Girds with a gilded crown, O Holy! thine inguinal organ,</l>
<l>Held by the pathic girls like in degree to a god.</l></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="poem"><l>Whoso comes hither shall a bard become</l>
<l>And to me dedicate facetious verse;</l>
<l>But who thiswise doth not, 'mid learnèd poets</l>
<l>Shall pace with fundament fulfilled of 'figs'.</l></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="poem"><l>Bailiff Aristagoras of his grapes high-pedigree'd boasting</l>
<l>Apples moulded in wax giveth, O Godhead, to thee:</l>
<l>But thou, pleased with the fruit in effigy placed on thine altar,</l>
<l>Genuine 'fruit' vouchsafe he, O Priapus! shall bear.</l></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="poem"><l>Refrain from deeming all my sayings be</l>
<l>In sport bespoken for mine own disport;</l>
<l>Thieves taken thrice or four tunes in the fact</l>
<l>(Believe my word) I'll surely irrumate.</l></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="poem"><l>What shouldest say this spear (although I'm wooden) be wishing</l>
<l>Whenas a maiden chance me in the middle to kiss?</l>
<l>Here none augur we: need: believe my word she is saying -</l>
<l>'Let the rude spear in me work with its natural wont!'</l></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="poem"><l>Whenas the Rigid God espied a wight</l>
<l>Crisping his head with curling-tongs aglow</l>
<l>That he be likest to a Moorish maid,</l>
<l>'Ho thou! (cried he) we tell thee, catamite;</l>
<l>However much thou toast and curl thyself</l>
<l>Is then a damsel more of worth, I ask,</l>
<l>Than are the hairy honours of thy yard?'</l></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="poem"><l>Ho girl! no whiter-skinned than Moorish man</l>
<l>Yet, Oh! than every pathic softer far;</l>
<l>Squatter than Pygmey fearful of the crane;</l>
<l>Harsher and hairier than pelt of bear;</l>
<l>Looser than Median or than Indian hose;</l>
<l>Remain as please thee or at will depart.</l>
<l>For, though full ready seem I, yet I want</l>
<l>Of rockets half-score bundles at the least,</l>
<l>Ere I that ditch-like groin can scrub and crush</l>
<l>The swarming wormlets of thy privy parts.</l></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="poem"><l>Who of you people here shall come to sup</l>
<l>Yet bring no verses suited to my taste;</l>
<l>I pray his wife or punk, hot-wantoning,</l>
<l>Reduce his rival to most languid state;</l>
<l>While he, all lonely through the livelong night,</l>
<l>Lie, by the lustful rockets sore disturbed.</l></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="poem"><l>Tho' see you drenchèd wet that part of me</l>
<l>Whereby Priapus I am signified;</l>
<l>Nor dew (believe me!) 'twas nor hoary frost,</l>
<l>But whatso gusheth of its own accord</l>
<l>When I bethink me of a pathic god.</l></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="poem"><l>Thou, who art 'customed to view around the walls of our temple</l>
<l>Verse of a strain jocose rather than modest and chaste,</l>
<l>Cease to be hurt by the song obscene, for verily ne'er was</l>
<l>Wont our mentule to wear eyebrow up-drawn in surprise.</l></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="poem"><l>A certain person, an thou please (Priapus!),</l>
<l>Plays me, a girl with piles full many piled;</l>
<l>And nor she gives me nor denies her gift,</l>

<l>But, if to 'joy her shall our lot befall,</l>
<l>We will (Priapus!) gird thy total yard</l>
<l>With the twin garlands to thy favours due.</l></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="poem"><l>What be this pother? For what cause suspects</l>
<l>My mind so many thieves will rob my garth,</l>
<l>When all pay forfeit (as on us they light)</l>
<l>Of being diggèd deep to bending loins?</l>
<l>Here be no better Figs than neighbours, figs</l>
